### Task Description

Develop a Python-based backend system that splits a large text document into
manageable sections, summarizes each section abstractly using the OpenAI API,
and combines the partial summaries into a coherent overall summary. You will
be provided with an API key and a GitHub repository containing a plain-text
file ready for processing.

### Key Aspects for Evaluation

1. **Text Segmentation:**
   - Implement logic to split long documents into smaller, cohesive sections
     suitable for individual summarization.
   - Ensure that the segmentation retains the necessary context for accurate
     summarization.

2. **API Usage:**
   - Use an OpenAI model via the provider's web API to perform the summarization.
   - Handle authentication, request formatting, and response processing efficiently.

3. **Merging Summaries:**
   - Develop a method to combine individual summaries into a comprehensive and
     coherent final summary.
   - Ensure logical flow and readability in the aggregated summary.

4. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - Implement robust error-handling mechanisms to address potential issues
     during API calls or text processing.
   - Integrate structured logging to monitor system performance and diagnose
     errors.

### Expected Deliverables

- A Python module implementing the described functionality.
- Distribution of the module as a Git project on GitHub.
- Clear instructions for setting up and running the system, including all
  dependencies.
- A short report explaining design decisions, challenges encountered, solutions
  implemented, and assumptions made.

### Timeline

This task is designed to be completed within 4 to 6 hours. It provides an
opportunity to demonstrate your practical skills and understanding of the
required concepts without being overly time-consuming.

### Evaluation Focus

- Proficiency in Python programming and familiarity with relevant libraries.
- Ability to effectively use external APIs.
- Problem-solving skills and handling real-world challenges in text processing and summarization.
